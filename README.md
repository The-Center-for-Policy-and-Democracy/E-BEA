Emotional-Belief Expression Coding Analysis


Emotional-Belief Expression Analysis (EBA) is a coding method used in Advocacy Coalition Framework studies to better understand the emotions and beliefs of coalitions. It is a variation of past ACF belief coding and utilizes Philip Liefeld's [Discourse Network Analyzer](https://github.com/leifeld/dna).

Applications for EBA are suitable for any study of discourse and have been applied to news media, legislative testimony, and interview data. The approach was built from past Advocacy Coalition Framework belief studies and includes the efforts of Allegra Fullerton, Anna Durnov√°, Chris Weible, Kayla Gabehart, Jill Yordy, Emma Scheetz, Dhani Freeland, Kaite Imhoff, Anna Crawford, and Paul Apperson.

To apply EBA, download the above codebook and thesaurus. Tutorials for using DNA are included on Liefeld's git.
